# BrainCancer
This is a project of course Information Systems Design and Development in School of Information Management at WHU.
In this project, we build a brain-cancer knowledge base and a user-oriented website based on it.

## Quick review of this project
1. back-end<br/>
We use python flask to provide RESTful API to the front-end.
2. data<br/>
Files as input or result of Python code.
3. front-end<br/>
A website built with Vue.js.
4. predict_associated_tumors<br/>
It contains the python code to predict associated tumors by calculating the text similarity.
5. build_ontology.py<br/>
Put data we gathered into Owl.
6. extract_brain_areas_and_symptoms.py<br/>
It does what the file name says. 
7. reasoning_improve.py<br/>
In protege the reasoning result is a mass, thus we reason the associated_tumors by ourselves.
